I did the PHARMACY problem in APEX ORACLE ,I do not know why but what is specified below is not
included in the sql file,that is why I also wrote it here.

//

this is how I inserted data in the tables
one example is:
INSERT INTO "ORDERS" values (4,'phar_1','NurofenFORTE',8,'analgezice','218','02/07/2021')

POINT 1

//

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ORDER_ID)
FROM ORDERS
WHERE PHARMACY_ID='phar_1' and ORDER_DATE between '08/01/2021' and '8/31/2021'

//

SELECT SUM(PRODUCT_PRICE)
FROM ORDERS
WHERE PHARMACY_ID='phar_1' and ORDER_DATE between '08/01/2021' and '08/31/2021'

//

SELECT AVG(PRODUCT_PRICE)
FROM ORDERS
WHERE PHARMACY_ID='phar_1' and ORDER_DATE between '08/01/2021' and '08/31/2021'

//


POINT 2

//
used count distinct to avoid duplicate ORDER_ID 

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ORDER_ID)
FROM ORDERS
WHERE PHARMACY_ID='phar_2' and ORDER_DATE between '01/01/2021' and '12/31/2021' and PRODUCT_CATEGORY='antibiotice'

//


POINT 3

//

did not manage to do this
